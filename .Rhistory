#### Step 3: define and add hyperparameters
## Guide to setup hyperparameters
## 1. get correct hyperparameter names:
# all variables in paid_media_vars or organic_vars require hyperprameter and will be transformed by adstock & saturation
# difference between paid_media_vars and organic_vars is that paid_media_vars has spend that needs to be specified in paid_media_spends specifically
# run hyper_names() to get correct hyperparameter names. all names in hyperparameters must equal names from hyper_names(), case sensitive
## 2. get guidance for setting hyperparameter bounds:
# For geometric adstock, use theta, alpha & gamma. For weibull adstock, use shape, scale, alpha, gamma
# theta: In geometric adstock, theta is decay rate. guideline for usual media genre: TV c(0.3, 0.8), OOH/Print/Radio c(0.1, 0.4), digital c(0, 0.3)
# shape: In weibull adstock, shape controls the decay shape. Recommended c(0.0001, 2). The larger, the more S-shape. The smaller, the more L-shape
# scale: In weibull adstock, scale controls the decay inflexion point. Very conservative recommended bounce c(0, 0.1), becausee scale can increase adstocking half-life greaetly
# alpha: In s-curve transformation with hill function, alpha controls the shape between exponential and s-shape. Recommended c(0.5, 3). The larger the alpha, the more S-shape. The smaller, the more C-shape
# gamma: In s-curve transformation with hill function, gamma controls the inflexion point. Recommended bounce c(0.3, 1). The larger the gamma, the later the inflection point in the response curve
# helper plots: set plot to TRUE for transformation examples
plot_adstock(FALSE) # adstock transformation example plot, helping you understand geometric/theta and weibull/shape/scale transformation
plot_saturation(FALSE) # s-curve transformation example plot, helping you understand hill/alpha/gamma transformatio
## 3. set each hyperparameter bounds. They either contains two values e.g. c(0, 0.5), or only one value (in which case you've "fixed" that hyperparameter)
hyper_names(adstock = InputCollect$adstock, all_media = InputCollect$all_media)
hyperparameters <- list(
facebook_I_alphas = c(0.5, 3) # example bounds for alpha
,facebook_I_gammas = c(0.3, 1) # example bounds for gamma
,facebook_I_thetas = c(0, 0.3) # example bounds for theta
#,facebook_I_shapes = c(0.0001, 2) # example bounds for shape
#,facebook_I_scales = c(0, 0.1) # example bounds for scale
,print_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
,print_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
,print_S_thetas = c(0.1, 0.4)
#,print_S_shapes = c(0.0001, 2)
#,print_S_scales = c(0, 0.1)
,tv_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
,tv_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
,tv_S_thetas = c(0.3, 0.8)
#,tv_S_shapes = c(0.0001, 2)
#,tv_S_scales= c(0, 0.1)
,search_clicks_P_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
,search_clicks_P_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
,search_clicks_P_thetas = c(0, 0.3)
#,search_clicks_P_shapes = c(0.0001, 2)
#,search_clicks_P_scales = c(0, 0.1)
,ooh_S_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
,ooh_S_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
,ooh_S_thetas = c(0.1, 0.4)
#,ooh_S_shapes = c(0.0001, 2)
#,ooh_S_scales = c(0, 0.1)
,newsletter_alphas = c(0.5, 3)
,newsletter_gammas = c(0.3, 1)
,newsletter_thetas = c(0.1, 0.4)
#,newsletter_shapes = c(0.0001, 2)
#,newsletter_scales = c(0, 0.1)
)
## Add hyperparameters intu robyn_inputs()
InputCollect <- robyn_inputs(InputCollect = InputCollect
, hyperparameters = hyperparameters)
## NOTE: The example above is to get InputCollect for the first time and done in 2 steps
## NOTE: If hyperparameters are set before, robyn_inputs() can be also done in 1 step by providing the hyperparameters parameter immediately
